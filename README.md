# dankshit
Dankshit is a Minecraft resource pack which makes playing the game more DANK.

# How to add stuff

You can add custom sounds by following these steps:

1. Press `Win` + `R` and type `%appdata%`. Now open `.minecraft/assets/indexes/` and open the `1.14.json` with Notepad++, VS code or any other editor. 

2. Search for the sound or texture you want to replace. For example if you search for the explosion sound `explode1.ogg`, you'll quickly find it's path `minecraft/sounds/random/explode1.ogg`.

3. Create the path of the sound in this repository. For this example it would be `assets/minecraft/sounds/random`.

4. Add your sound to the created folder. (Note that it has to be named the same as the original sound and has to be an `.ogg` file)

# Tags and usage

Don't forget to create a tag/release of this project after adding anything to this repository.

After creating a tag/release you can download the automatically generated `dankshit.zip` and add it to your resourcepacks to use it ingame.
